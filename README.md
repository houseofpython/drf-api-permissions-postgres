# DRF Permissions & Postgresql


Features - General
You have been supplied with two demos, each presenting a key new feature.
One demonstrates how to restrict access to portions of your APIs data.
The other demonstrates switching over to using postgres vs sqlite
Your job is to merge the functionality of both demos.
Customize your project to use different application features/models than what was used in demos.
Features - Django REST Framework
Make your site a DRF powered API as you did in previous lab.
Adjust project’s permissions so that only authenticated user’s have access to API.
Add a custom permission so that only appropriate users can update or delete it.
Exactly what this means will depend on your application, so if you have any questions about “appropriate users” means reach out to TA/Instructor.
Add ability to switch user’s directly from browsable API.
